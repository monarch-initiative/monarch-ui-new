This correlation was largely based on comparable TAA modifications by<br>either systemic TGFβ neutralization or AT1r antagonism. However, subsequent<br>investigations have called into question some key aspects of this mechanism of<br>arterial disease in MFS. To resolve these controversial points, here we made a<br>head-to-head comparison of the therapeutic benefits of TGFβ neutralization and<br>AT1r antagonism in mice with progressively severe MFS (Fbn1(mgR/mgR) mice).<br>APPROACH AND RESULTS: Aneurysm growth, media degeneration, aortic levels of<br>phosphorylated Erk and Smad proteins and the average survival of Fbn1(mgR/mgR)<br>mice were compared after a ≈3-month-long treatment with placebo and either the<br>AT1r antagonist losartan or the TGFβ-neutralizing antibody 1D11. In contrast to<br>the beneficial effect of losartan, TGFβ neutralization either exacerbated or<br>mitigated TAA formation depending on whether treatment was initiated before<br>(postnatal day 16; P16) or after (P45) aneurysm formation, respectively.<br>Biochemical evidence-related aneurysm growth with Erk-mediated AT1r signaling,<br>and medial degeneration with TGFβ hyperactivity that was in part AT1r dependent. <br>Importantly, P16-initiated treatment with losartan combined with P45-initiated<br>administration of 1D11 prevented death of Fbn1(mgR/mgR) mice from ruptured TAA.<br>CONCLUSIONS: By demonstrating that promiscuous AT1r and TGFβ drive partially<br>overlapping processes of arterial disease in MFS mice, our study argues for a<br>therapeutic strategy against TAA that targets both signaling pathways although<br>sparing the early protective role of TGFβ.<br><br>© 2015 American Heart Association, Inc.<br><br>DOI: 10.1161/ATVBAHA.114.305150 <br>PMCID: PMC4376614<br>PMID: 25614286  [Indexed for MEDLINE]"
