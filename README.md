# DO NOT USE

This is the "old" repo for the Monarch UI webapp version 3.0.
The bulk of v3 was originally developed and deployed here, but has since been migrated to a mono-repo containing both the front and backend:

https://github.com/monarch-initiative/monarch-api

Eventually, this repo will be archived and the site hosted here will be removed.
The last state of the code has been transferred to the mono-repo, as well as the issues, but some things – like full commit history and pull-request history with comments – couldn't be transferred and must remain in this repo for posterity.
You should not use or reference this repo unless you are deeply involved in the development of the frontend or backend.
