## Development

### Overview

This is a Vue project that has been initialized with [`vue-cli`](https://cli.vuejs.org/) with the following options:

- Yarn
- Vue 3
- TypeScript
- Eslint and Prettier
- Vuex (for global state management)
- Vue router
- Jest (unit testing, via [`vue-test-utils`](https://next.vue-test-utils.vuejs.org/guide/))
- Cypress (e2e testing, via [`vue-test-utils`](https://next.vue-test-utils.vuejs.org/guide/))
- Sass (with dart-sass)

Additional notable features:

- [Axe](https://www.deque.com/axe/) (via [`jest-axe`](https://github.com/nickcolley/jest-axe)) for accessibility testing

### Setup

Install [Node](https://nodejs.org/) (> 14) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) if you haven't already.
Clone the repo and run `yarn install` to install dependencies.

### Commands

- `yarn serve` - Start development server with auto-refresh and hot-reloading
- `yarn build` - Build a production version of the app
- `yarn test:lint` - Run lint check
- `yarn test:unit` - Run unit tests
- `yarn test:e2e` - Run end-to-end tests
- `yarn test:axe` - Run accessibility tests
- `yarn test` - Run all tests (except for e2e gui)
- `yarn lint` - Lint and fix files
- `yarn test:gui` - Run end-to-end tests in visible browser to watch them run
- `yarn fresh` - Clear cache and `node_modules` and reinstall dependencies

### Continuous Integration

On pull requests, the app is automatically tested and will not allow merging without all tests passing and at least one peer review.
Netlify is used to build and host live deploy previews of the changes in a PR for convenient in-situ testing.

When merging into main, the app is automatically built and deployed to GitHub Pages at a custom top-level-domain url.
Note: To simplify app/router/etc configuration, the app only works when served from root.
Hosting at a default GitHub Pages url like monarch-initiative.github.io/monarch-ui is not possible without changes.

### Directory structure

- `/.github` - GitHub Actions continuous integration workflows for testing and deploying the app.
- `/dist` - Where the built app is outputted to after running `yarn build`.
- `/figma` - Backup/local copy of Figma sketch for app.
- `/public` - Folder whose contents gets copied over verbatim to build folder.
  Use as little as possible; prefer `/assets`.
- `/src` - Main source code that gets compiled, along with installed packages in `/node_modules`, into the final product.

  - `/api` - Code that acts as an interface between external resources and components.
    Code here should do as much work as possible to simplify, clean, and otherwise transform data into the format that `.vue` files need so that they can remain mostly presentational.
    TypeScript types prefixed with a `_` denote data schemas returned from the backend, and types without the prefix denote the data schemas needed for the frontend.
  - `/assets` - Static resources like images.
  - `/components` - Reusable building blocks of UI.
  - `/global` - Components, directives, styles, and other "global" resources that always -- whether running the app normally or setting up and mounting a test -- need to be included in the Vue application instance.
  - `/router` - See [Vue router](https://router.vuejs.org/).
  - `/store` - See [Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/) (similar to Redux).
    Most useful for managing global and complex state.
  - `/util` - Miscellaneous utility functions to do generic tasks.
  - `/views` - Organizes the site into pages.
    Directory structure and file names should correlate to urls.

- `/tests` - Suite of tests to verify functionality and ensure quality.
- `package.json` - What third party packages are necessary for this app to run, and which versions.
  Also where the `yarn ___` shorthand commands are defined.
  `yarn.lock` - Detailed list of all dependencies and sub-dependencies, and their versions, providing a last known good configuration.
- `.eslintrc.js`, `babel.config.js`, etc. - Separate configuration files for the various tools involved in the development pipeline.
- `.env` - Environment variable file.
  A convenient place to set static string values that need to be repeated throughout the app.

### Guidelines and notes

Use JSDoc style comments (`/** some comment */`) instead of regular JavaScript comments.
This allows lint checking and auto-fixing/auto-formatting of long comments wrapping to new lines.
More importantly, it allows for better editor integration, meaning that hovering over a function/parameter/object/etc. key will show its associated JSDoc comment.
There are user snippets, shortcuts, and extensions you can use to make this as convenient as regular comments.

Where possible and appropriate, use custom components like `AppHeading` and `AppLink` instead of native elements like `h1` and `a`.

See `variables.scss` for a palette of acceptable colors/fonts/etc to use.

Keep configuration files as minimal as possible and conform to third-party-maintained presets.
For example, avoid overriding default eslint rules as much as possible.

Keep long lists, such as those in `/global`, sorted alphabetically for consistency and ease of lookup and comparison.
Tip: use VS Code extension "Sort Lines".

Use `console.log` for strictly for temporary debugging during local development that should be removed before merging PRs.
Use `console.error` for in-production logging of _caught_ errors.
Use `console.info` for generic in-production logging, but only use for major, infrequent events, as logging too frequently (say, multiple times per second, sustained) can impact page performance.
Leaving select logging in production will be beneficial for in this particular app, for user and in-situ troubleshooting of complex, hard-to-replicate problems.

To analyze the size of the compiled bundle, dev-install `stats-webpack-plugin`, uncomment the `stats-webpack-plugin` line in `vue.config.js`, build the app, then run either `npx webpack-bundle-analyzer dist/stats.json` or `npx source-map-explorer dist/js/*`.

To spell check the entire repo (aside from `node_modules`), run `npx cspell "**/*.{scss,js,ts,json,vue,svg,yaml}"`.
