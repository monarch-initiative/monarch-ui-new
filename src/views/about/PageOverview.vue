    <p>
      The Monarch Initiative is more than just this website, it is a whole
      ecosystem of related tools. This diagram illustrates the architecture of
      how it all fits together.

    <p>
      Structured and unstructured data sources are loaded into SciGraph via
      dipper (1), our data ingest pipeline. A variety of ontologies are
      processed in the Monarch Integration Layer and are also loaded into
      SciGraph, resulting in a combined knowledge and data graph (2). Data is
      disseminated via SciGraph Services, wrapped around by the BioLink API (3).
      This lightweight API makes few assumptions, acting as a data access layer
      for all of Monarchâ€™s Services. Users can interrogate Monarch using our
      tools for text annotation, navigating the ontologies, and matching
      phenotype profiles (4).
