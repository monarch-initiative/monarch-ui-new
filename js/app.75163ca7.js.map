While we display the variants and\n      interpretations as originally reported in the variant databases, some\n      variants in the same genes have been reported on different transcripts.\n      Whenever possible, Monarch will attempt to map all variants in a\n      particular gene to a common transcript to aid in viewing and organizing\n      the variants. However, to aid in variant searches, we will also continue\n      to report the original mapping information. All interpretations were\n      performed by the original submitters and have not been modified in any\n      way. As such, there might be discordant interpretations for the same\n      variant from different archives. For further information or to request a\n      review of the variant, please contact the submitter of the original\n      reference. Variant interpretations are not static as they are based on the\n      current understanding of the variant at the time it was observed in a\n      patient or in the literature. Any reported interpretation may not be\n      up-to-date, and some information may not be reported. Many interpretations\n      will change over time as more information about the variant becomes\n      available. If you have any questions about a variant interpretation or\n      would like use any variant interpretations for publication purposes,\n      please contact the submitter of the original reference. As always, we\n      value your feedback. Please email us if you have any problems, concerns,\n      or suggestions.\n    </p>\n  </AppSection>\n</template>\n","import { render } from \"./Terms.vue?vue&type=template&id=7a9d3833\"\nconst script = {}\n\nimport exportComponent from \"/home/runner/work/monarch-ui-new/monarch-ui-new/node_modules/vue-loader-v16/dist/exportHelper.js\"\nconst __exports__ = /*#__PURE__*/exportComponent(script, [['render',render]])\n\nexport default __exports__","import { createElementVNode as _createElementVNode, resolveComponent as _resolveComponent, createVNode as _createVNode, createTextVNode as _createTextVNode, withCtx as _withCtx, resolveDirective as _resolveDirective, withDirectives as _withDirectives, renderList as _renderList, Fragment as _Fragment, openBlock as _openBlock, createElementBlock as _createElementBlock, createBlock as _createBlock, createCommentVNode as _createCommentVNode } from \"vue\"\n\nconst _hoisted_1 = /*#__PURE__*/_createElementVNode(\"h1\", null, \"Help\", -1)\nconst _hoisted_2 = /*#__PURE__*/_createTextVNode(\" If you have a GitHub account, know the relevant respository, and have a specific feature request or bug report, you can also directly \")\nconst _hoisted_3 = /*#__PURE__*/_createTextVNode(\"create an issue on GitHub\")\nconst _hoisted_4 = /*#__PURE__*/_createTextVNode(\".
