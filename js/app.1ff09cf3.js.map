Variant interpretations are not static as they are based on the\n      current understanding of the variant at the time it was observed in a\n      patient or in the literature. Any reported interpretation may not be\n      up-to-date, and some information may not be reported. Many interpretations\n      will change over time as more information about the variant becomes\n      available.
