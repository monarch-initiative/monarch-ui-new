While we display the variants and\n      interpretations as originally reported in the variant databases, some\n      variants in the same genes have been reported on different transcripts.\n      Whenever possible, Monarch will attempt to map all variants in a\n      particular gene to a common transcript to aid in viewing and organizing\n      the variants. However, to aid in variant searches, we will also continue\n      to report the original mapping information. All interpretations were\n      performed by the original submitters and have not been modified in any\n      way. As such, there might be discordant interpretations for the same\n      variant from different archives. For further information or to request a\n      review of the variant, please contact the submitter of the original\n      reference. Variant interpretations are not static as they are based on the\n      current understanding of the variant at the time it was observed in a\n      patient or in the literature. Any reported interpretation may not be\n      up-to-date, and some information may not be reported. Many interpretations\n      will change over time as more information about the variant becomes\n      available. If you have any questions about a variant interpretation or\n      would like use any variant interpretations for publication purposes,\n      please contact the submitter of the original reference. As always, we\n      value your feedback.
