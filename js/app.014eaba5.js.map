While we display the variants and\n      interpretations as originally reported in the variant databases, some\n      variants in the same genes have been reported on different transcripts.\n      Whenever possible, Monarch will attempt to map all variants in a\n      particular gene to a common transcript to aid in viewing and organizing\n      the variants. However, to aid in variant searches, we will also continue\n      to report the original mapping information. All interpretations were\n      performed by the original submitters and have not been modified in any\n      way. As such, there might be discordant interpretations for the same\n      variant from different archives. For further information or to request a\n      review of the variant, please contact the submitter of the original\n      reference. Variant interpretations are not static as they are based on the\n      current understanding of the variant at the time it was observed in a\n      patient or in the literature. Any reported interpretation may not be\n      up-to-date, and some information may not be reported. Many interpretations\n      will change over time as more information about the variant becomes\n      available. If you have any questions about a variant interpretation or\n      would like use any variant interpretations for publication purposes,\n      please contact the submitter of the original reference. As always, we\n      value your feedback. Please email us if you have any problems, concerns,\n      or suggestions.\n    </p>\n  </AppSection>\n</template>\n","import { render } from \"./Terms.vue?vue&type=template&id=fb6e6e80\"\nconst script = {}\n\nimport exportComponent from \"/home/runner/work/monarch-ui-new/monarch-ui-new/node_modules/vue-loader-v16/dist/exportHelper.js\"\nconst __exports__ = /*#__PURE__*/exportComponent(script, [['render',render]])\n\nexport default __exports__","import { createTextVNode as _createTextVNode, resolveComponent as _resolveComponent, withCtx as _withCtx, createVNode as _createVNode, createElementVNode as _createElementVNode, openBlock as _openBlock, createBlock as _createBlock, createCommentVNode as _createCommentVNode, renderList as _renderList, Fragment as _Fragment, createElementBlock as _createElementBlock, pushScopeId as _pushScopeId, popScopeId as _popScopeId } from \"vue\"\n\nconst _withScopeId = n => (_pushScopeId(\"data-v-c26e7474\"),n=n(),_popScopeId(),n)\nconst _hoisted_1 = /*#__PURE__*/_createTextVNode(\"Help\")\nconst _hoisted_2 = /*#__PURE__*/ _withScopeId(() => /*#__PURE__*/_createElementVNode(\"p\", null, \" Request a feature, report a bug, or chat with us about anything Monarch-related. \", -1))\nconst _hoisted_3 = /*#__PURE__*/_createTextVNode(\"How to use this website\")\nconst _hoisted_4 = /*#__PURE__*/_createTextVNode(\"Status\")\nconst _hoisted_5 = /*#__PURE__*/_createTextVNode(\" If you still need help, or for general inquires, you can \")\nconst _hoisted_6 = /*#__PURE__*/_createTextVNode(\"email us\")\nconst _hoisted_7 = /*#__PURE__*/_createTextVNode(\" or \")\nconst _hoisted_8 = /*#__PURE__*/_createTextVNode(\"tweet us\")\nconst _hoisted_9 = /*#__PURE__*/_createTextVNode(\". \")\n\nexport function render(_ctx: any,_cache: any,$props: any,$setup: any,$data: any,$options: any) {\n  const _component_AppHeading = _resolveComponent(\"AppHeading\")!\n  const _component_AppTile = _resolveComponent(\"AppTile\")!\n  const _component_AppFlex = _resolveComponent(\"AppFlex\")!\n  const _component_AppSection = _resolveComponent(\"AppSection\")!\n  const _component_AppPlaceholder = _resolveComponent(\"AppPlaceholder\")!\n  const _component_AppGallery = _resolveComponent(\"AppGallery\")!\n  const _component_AppStatus = _resolveComponent(\"AppStatus\")!\n  const _component_AppButton = _resolveComponent(\"AppButton\")!\n  const _component_AppLink = _resolveComponent(\"AppLink\")!\n\n  return (_openBlock(), _createElementBlock(_Fragment, null, [\n    _createVNode(_component_AppSection, null, {\n      default: _withCtx(() => [\n        _createVNode(_component_AppHeading, null, {\n          default: _withCtx(() => [\n            _hoisted_1\n          ]),\n          _: 1\n        }),\n        _hoisted_2,\n        _createVNode(_component_AppFlex, { gap: \"big\" }, {\n          default: _withCtx(() => [\n            _createVNode(_component_AppTile, {\n              icon: \"comment\",\n              title: \"Feedback Form\",\n              subtitle: \"Right here, no account required, one-way\",\n              to: \"/feedback\"\n            }),\n            _createVNode(_component_AppTile, {\n              icon: \"comments\",\n              title: \"Help Desk\",\n              subtitle: \"On GitHub, requires account, two-way\",\n              to: \"https://github.com/monarch-initiative/helpdesk\"\n            })\n          ]),\n          _: 1\n        })\n      ]),\n      _: 1\n    }),\n    _createVNode(_component_AppSection, null, {\n      default: _withCtx(() => [\n        _createVNode(_component_AppHeading, null, {\n          default: _withCtx(() => [\n            _hoisted_3\n          ]),\n          _: 1\n        }),\n        _createVNode(_component_AppGallery, null, {\n          default: _withCtx(() => [\n            _createVNode(_component_AppPlaceholder),\n            _createVNode(_component_AppPlaceholder),\n            _createVNode(_component_AppPlaceholder),\n            _createVNode(_component_AppPlaceholder),\n            _createVNode(_component_AppPlaceholder),\n            _createVNode(_component_AppPlaceholder)\n          ]),\n          _: 1\n        })\n      ]),\n      _: 1\n    }),\n    _createVNode(_component_AppSection, null, {\n      default: _withCtx(() => [\n        _createVNode(_component_AppHeading, null, {\n          default: _withCtx(() => [\n            _hoisted_4\n          ]),\n          _: 1\n        }),\n        (_ctx.status)\n          ?
